Hi there! 

I am a master of environmental data science (MEDS) graduate from UC Santa Barbara (UCSB), where I learned to integrate programmatic geospatial and statistical analysis into the environmental field. The MEDS program has taught me to appreciate open-source learning and the value of reproducible workflows. My capstone project involved increasing the accessibility and usability of the National Snow & Ice Data Center (NSIDC) Snow Today website through web-based visualizations and in-depth and comprehensive Python tutorials for using snow and albedo datasets. If youâ€™d like to learn more about my capstone project, please use the link above.
