Hi there! I am a master of environmental data science (MEDS) student at UC Santa Barbara (UCSB), where I am learning to integrate programmatic geospatial and statistical analysis into the environmental field. The MEDS program has taught me to appreciate open-source learning and the value of reproducible workflows. I hope to utilize my newfound skills to optimize efficency, visualize technically complex datasets, and expand data scienceâ€™s use in everyday life.
